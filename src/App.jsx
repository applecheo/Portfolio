      <h2>Hello, I'm Jun Jie</h2>
      <p style={{ textAlign: "center", margin: 10, maxWidth: 400 }}>
        As a teenager, I was always intrigued by people using their technical
        ability in information technology to do amazing things but didnâ€™t have
        the courage to try it out myself. Hence, I proceeded to do my Diploma in
        Marine Science and Aquaculture. After my internship, I am more affirmed
        that I want to be in the tech industry hence I took a leap of faith to
        try out programming and immediately fell in love.
